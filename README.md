This is just a basic project that uses self generated data
to make a classification prediction on whether or not a person can reach the top shelf 
depending on their height and if they have access to a stool. 

It uses pickle to store the best model after partitioning testing and training data 90/10

Finally the model is printed out, coefficients, accuracy, as well as a comparison
between actual value and predicted value for each test data sample.
